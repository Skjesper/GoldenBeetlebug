## üéÆ Overview

- **Global Leaderboard**: Save your score to compete with other players
- **Responsive Design**: Layout adapts to different screen sizes (with portrait orientation warning)
- **Stylish UI**: Custom-designed interface with themed elements

## üéØ Game Mechanics

1. **Objective**: Click on as many Rune characters as possible within the time limit (30 seconds)
2. **Controls**: Use your mouse/cursor (styled as a champagne bottle) to catch Runes, or finger/touch on mobile
3. **Scoring**: Each caught Rune gives 10 points
4. **Timer**: A countdown timer shows your remaining time
5. **Game Over**: When the timer reaches zero, the game ends and displays your score
6. **Leaderboard**: After the game, you can save your score to the leaderboard

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account (for leaderboard functionality)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rune-hunt.git
   cd rune-hunt
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Supabase credentials:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   API_KEY=yourapikeyhere
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **React**: UI library
- **TypeScript**: Type safety
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server
- **Emotion**: CSS-in-JS styling
- **React Router**: Navigation between pages
- **Supabase**: Backend for leaderboard functionality

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Setup

The game uses Supabase as its backend. You'll need to create a table called `scores` with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE scores (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  nickname TEXT NOT NULL,
  points INTEGER NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create an index for faster leaderboard queries
CREATE INDEX scores_points_idx ON scores (points DESC);
```
